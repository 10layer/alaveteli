Next (things that will reduce admin time mainly)
====

- "Can I help out" a bit invisible

Keep URL through funnel for Louise

Destroy request - does it remove the tags?

Richard says he wants the internationalisation to be so it could be one site
with combined search. Why obey the notion of a country? I'm not sure, but
it might be prudent to write it so it can run multiple jurisdictions in 
one deploy, if only for administrative reasoins.
    - path maybe: lib/juris/uk, lib/juris/eu etc.
    - consider Single Table Inheritance (harder to back out of though)
    - use mixins with explicit include otherwise

Add links to these tags where possible:
    ch:* - Bodies that appear on the Register of Companies. '*' is replaced by the company number, which is eight characters long and consists of optional upper-case letters followed by digits.
    coins:* Bodies appearing in COINS database followed by reference code e.g. coins:BRL048 (British Library)
    dpr:* - Bodies that appear on the Register of Data Controllers. '*' is replaced by the registration number.
    urn:* - Bodies that appear on EduBase. '*' is replaced by the institution's Unique Reference Number.
    VAT:* - Bodies with a VAT (UK Value Added Tax) registration number. '*' is replaced by the VAT registration number (no spaces) e.g. VAT:895108987
http://foiwiki.com/foiwiki/index.php/WhatDoTheyKnow.com_Tags

Merge with New Zealand code base properly

Handle bounce messages from alerts automatically

Make it so when you make followups the whole request is shown on the page.
Remove all show_response URLs, and replace with a special version of the
request URL with a new input box at the bottom and a hash link to it?
<< when following links such as "I'm about to send clarification", a
form appears into which the reply can be typed. However, the
previous correspondence in that thread is not shown.
I usually open a new tab to see what was written previously before
writing in the form. It might be useful if the previous
correspondence were instead shown on the page in which the form
appears. >>

Make profile photo on comments slightly larger

Ask people for annotation immediately after they have submitted their request
Ask for annotation about what they learnt from request?

Performance
===========

Reduce storing the number of bogus post redirects that aren't people

Receiving email can be resource drain starting app instance each time - use daemon instead

Cache /feed/list/successful
Cache /body/list/a

Cache parts of /body/xxxxx
Cache parts of /user/xxxxx

Finish migration to Rails 1.9 - for uncached requests, seems to be twice as fast.

Regular expression library - change to faster one. Oniguruma isn't enough.
This shows slowness:
    e = InfoRequestEvent.find(213700)
    text = e.incoming_message.get_main_body_text (XXX alter to call internal not cache)
    IncomingMessage.remove_quoted_sections(text, "")

This is slow:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/renumeration_committee

Varnish config
http://www.varnish-cache.org/wiki/VCLExampleCachingLoggedInUsers

Some requests to lower memory use of still:
PID: 676    CONSUME MEMORY: 16968 KB    Now: 102604 KB  http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/parking_ticket_data_81
PID: 2036       CONSUME MEMORY: 129368 KB       Now: 179652 KB  http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/14186/response/33740
- search engines shouldn't be going for those URLs. and do they really need to
  unpack so much? could use snippet cache.

Things to make bots not crawl somehow:
    /request/13683/response?internal_review=1
    /request/febrile_neutropenia_154?unfold=1

Renaming of a body, or changing its domain, should clear the cached bubbles of
all requests to that body.


Letting you hide individual events (incoming/outgoing messages, annotations)
==================================

*** this needs either removing or finishing, it is half done. Has the
database entries but doesn't use them yet.

Move comments to use new system first
Show message to signed in user that others can't see this part
Make sure hidden things don't show in search snippets
    in models/comment.rb: # So when made invisble it vanishes
Remove comments visible


Later
=====

JSON API:
    Pagination on the Atom feed JSON, so you can get later pages, and/or choose > 25 items
    Information about attachments in event JSON
    Allow Javascript callbacks (JSONP)
    Displayable status (i.e. text not code) as parameter on info requests

Spelling correction not working if you search for "comission", as described here:
    http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.search.xapian.general/8384
When this patch from Xapian is in stable version, check that it all works.
    http://trac.xapian.org/changeset/14859

Make outgoing requests and follow ups get CCed to our backup mailbox, so that
can do data recovery more easily

Admin button to resend request one off to particular address

Stop search for users working on unconfirmed accounts

Make zip file contents browseable, so each document in them "appears in Google".
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/transport_direct_cycle_journey_p#incoming-78421

Ability to move requests to other bodies. Useful in these two places - anywhere else?
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/suffolk_primary_care_trust_pct_duplicate
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/colchester_hospital_university_nhs_foundation_trust_duplicate

In admin interface, move a response from the holding pen to a request which is
closed to new responses. The message disappears into the ether. Should either
stop or allow such moves.

PDF that gets corrupted by email censoring - have only seen this once, watch for it again
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/information_on_traffic_flows_in
The image in a "stream" section get corrupted:
    _#p!/DB]eER4cPAPm&W7;-]L!e(*U=7"h^X7hYXqSI][9UZJV+>hr2:&c@S.lRr.ndm)2]b$-lU+#lg
    _#p!/DB]eER4cPAPm&W7;-]L!e(*U=7"h^X7hYXqSI][9UZJV+>hr2:&x@x.xxx.xxx)2]b$-lU+#lg
Needs a fancy PDF library (which doesn't exist yet) that can tell when it is
binary or text stream within the file. See thread in email "corrupted pdf" for
more details. Maybe have option in admin to turn off censoring on a particular file.

check-recent-requests-sent probably doesn't work, as exim log lines wouldn't
be load in case where the envelope from gets broken?

Point all MX records to one server, so can see incoming messages in exim logs also.
Hmmm, but less robust. Run the exim log grabber across all mail servers?

XXX Not sure all this matters really, requests seems to be getting through better these days?
Make request addresses easier to type in again, and routing work better:
* Put the request from address in the database, 
    XXX make sure it knows the type, as need fuzzy rule for matching/guessing according to type
then change the rule for making it.
* Change holding pen to lookup hash e.g. 1bd8ea of the request address in database
 (so gives good guess it the hash is right, but the number is wrong)
* Use maybe words for generated email address? Name of the person and a request
number (i.e. number of that persons request, so there are few numbers)?
julian.todd@section44.whatdotheyknow.com
* Use words from a dictionary, e.g. cat, mouse, rat, hat etc.
* Use single words from the request, e.g. section, terrorism, allotment
* Make sure avoid FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS rule in Spam Assassin
* It looks like an error generated by GFI MailEssentials, see p62 of chapter
    11 of the manual at http://www.gfi.com/mes/me11manual.pdf which states:
    7. Check if emails contain more than X numbers in the MIME from:
    Frequently, more than 3 numbers in the MIME from means that the sender is a
    spammer. The reason for this is that spammers often use tools to
    automatically create reply-to: addresses on hotmail and other free email
    services. Frequently they use 3 or more numbers in the name to make sure
    the reply-to: is unique.
* Use FOI code allocated by authority to work out where emails are to go
* Second request to same authority by same person - tell them to be sure
to use the right email
* Improve routing from Exim so copes with addresses not having request- prefix.

When on a small screen, the actual form when making a new request is below
the fold, and it isn't obvious what you need to do. (Seen while watching 
a new user try to make a request)

Put public body name in search text for each info request, so that people
typing in a word and a body name in the search (have seen people new
to the site doing that) do find things

Completely remove the "feed" option in the database from tracks (it is only
there for historical reasons, as feeds used to have to be explicitly in the 
database)

Show the Subject: lines on request pages. Perhaps only show them where they are
substantively different (modulo Re: and Fwd:) from the title and other subjects
- so you can see any FOI code number the authority has put in the subject.

For Scotland, don't need to say "normally" equivocally when it is taking more than 20 days
(as there is no public interest test).

Add explicit option for user to select "misdelivered to the wrong request"
and let people move them to the right place.
(Julian wants that too)

Perhaps fold up request pages more by default - don't show known acknowledgements until
you click and some (javascript) expands them.

Some people want the fold/unfold of quoted sections to be javascripty as well.
Esp. when filling in a form on the same page.

Somehow make clear that a "rejection because referring to info already
in public domain" should really be marked sucessful.

Emails sent to stopped requests should follow RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3834
    Shouldn't bounce message back to Auto-Submitted 
    Should check from address being replied to is valid
    Should set In-Reply-To and References fields
    Reconsider message content given that section in RFC

When registering a new user, give a warning if they only enter one name. Link
to the help about pseudonymous requests, that you need at least initial
as well.

Let requesters view the uncensored versions of their correspondence (e.g. with
emails in it). Let other people do so with a CAPTCHA?

For followups, have radio button to say is it a new request or followup
Do by uncommenting the "new information" option when writing a followup, so
that it makes a new request

When it prompts error_message people to send annotation, maybe just show them
the email address of the error to check then and there?

If you've already conducted an internal review, at all places 
    - when on unhappy/url
    - when on not held link
    - on the page for the request
don't offer it again, as they've already done it.
Example of completed review:
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/request_for_full_disclosure_of_b#incoming-9267

Don't allow sending internal review text twice (although make sure they 
can write followups to internal review)
e.g. http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/reply_to_letter_from_historic_ro

Clock for internal review
    The Information Commissioner has issued a "Good Practice Guidance" document:
    http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/foi_good_practice_guidance_5.pdf
    20 days is late
    40 days max.
Fix up the text: "The internal review should take 2-3 weeks for simple cases,
and up to 6 weeks even for complex reviews."
Awaiting internal review overdue state?

Sort requests on user page by status. 
    "For sorting I was just thinking of a generic sort/filter by clicking
    on the header or some such -- I'd probably want to sort open requests
    in order of 'last action'... to quickly see what was most overdue."
Group list on user page by authority 

I have several email alerts set up. Is there any chance they could include part
(or, preferably, all) of the search criterion in the Subject: line? :o)
(Perhaps do it in the case when only one search criterion makes the mail)

Search for text "internal review" in followups and add warning if they aren't
using the internal review mode.

CSS / design things
    - The stepwise instruction boxes "Next, select the public authority ... "
      need to look better, and have icons associated with them etc.
    - CSS error on "all councils" page on some browsers
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424194
    - Spacing on error boxes round form elements. Matthew says:
            Well, the correct thing to do is have the class="fieldWithErrors" on the
            <p> containing the Summary: label and text input box, not have the
            pointless <span> at all, and then it all looks perfect and as you'd
            expect. But I had a look at the code and haven't got the slightest clue
            how you'd do that, sorry, given it appears new.rhtml is printing the <p>
            but some magic Ruby thing is printing the error span.
    - Improve CSS on IE7 for large images in docs
        http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/3289/response/7810/attach/html/3/20081023ReplyLetter.pdf.html
    - Get Atom feed of search results to include stylesheet for highlighting words in
      yellow somehow

When doing search, people often just want it to show the whole page. Perhaps
all listing should just link to top of page, rather than # links for outgoing
incoming, or perhaps just some of them.

Some more traditional help (in a new section in the help) such as:
    * Information about how to track requests and RSS feeds 
    * Information about how to contacting other users
    * How to change your email address

Show similar requests after you have filed yours - maybe on preview too.

Test code for rendering lots of different attachments and filetypes
Test code for internal review submitting

Protect from CSRF with this in app controller (care it doesn't break anything):
  # See ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for details
    # Uncomment the :secret if you're not using the cookie session store
      protect_from_forgery # :secret => '<%= app_secret %>'

Look at quote_address_if_necessary in actionmailer's quoting.rb - why did it
not work for the email address with "@" in its name part?

Should group by the request id for search queries (so all appear
together when request and response mention same term)

Something to check which tags are used but aren't in PublicBody category lists

Change it to store emails as files in the filesystem? For speed of backup if nothing else.
Should have simpler system for us to upload files sent to us via CD etc.
Currently we have to manually put them in the files directory on the vhost.
Make it so web upload interface copes gracefully with arbitarily large messages
(it causes speed trouble having them in the database right now)

Compress the emails in the database
Don't store the cached text in backups - maybe keep it in its own table to avoid that?

Other references to title field changes don't get search index updated when title is altered
    (e.g. when a public body is renamed)
Maybe just reindex all once a week, but it is a bit slow now, so perhaps do it properly.
$ ./script/rebuild-xapian-index

Renaming public authorities will break alerts on them. For basic alerts the
structured info is there so this should just be fixed. For searches, perhaps
Xapian index should search url_name history as well?
We have a policy of not renaming them in some cases, which helps a bit.

Never updates cached attachment text unless cache is explicitly cleared (which
    might matter with software updates, or code changes). Should we clear the
    cache automatically every month in the middle of the night or something?
$ ./script/clear-caches


Display and indexing of response emails/attachments
---------------------------------------------------

Install more recent poppler-utils
    e.g. 0.12.0 can definitely convert this to HTML, extacting the images:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/13903/response/36117/attach/html/4/FOI%20beaver%20site%20species%20audit%20SNH%20review%20of%20proposal%20redact.pdf.html
Really need a "pdftk -nodrm" to remove compression from encrypted PDFs, so strips emails from e.g.:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/14414/response/38590/attach/html/3/090807%20FOI.pdf.html
    ... this misses a whole page out (someone emailed us)
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/unredacted_expense_claims_for_jo#incoming-49674

Worth doing View as HTML ourselves for .docx, .ppt, .tif (covered now by Google Docs)
View as HTML for .txt requested

Failed to detect attachments are emails and decode them:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/malicious_communication_act#incoming-12964

When indexing .docx do you need to index docProps/custom.xml and docProps/app.xml
as well as word/document.xml ? (thread on xapian-discuss does so)

Consider using odt2txt or unoconv
http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/opendocument/

Mime type / extension wrong on these .docx's
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/bridleway_classifications
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/19976/response/51468/attach/3/TU%20MembershipTeachers%20SolidarityTU%20231009.docx.doc (thinks it is doc when it is docx)

    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/dog_control_orders#incoming-3510
    doing file RESPONSE/Internal documents/Briefing with Contact Islington/Contact Islington Flowchart Jul 08.vsd content type 

Search for other file extensions that we have now and look for ones we could
and should be indexing
    (call IncomingMessage.find_all_unknown_mime_types to find them - needs
    updating to do it in clumps as all requests won't load in RAM now )

Render HTML alternative rather than text (so tables look good) e.g.:
    http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/parking_policy

These attachment.bin files should come out as winmail.dat and be parsed
by existing TNEF code. For some reason though TMail doesn't get the right
content-type out of them. Not sure why.

Totally new features
--------------------

Publish statistics (stats) on how long it takes bodies to respond. And other
things (like the WriteToThem pages).

Add interface for editing tags on your own requests so you can keep track of them more easily. 
Lisa asked for this - is definitely only whole requests needed. Tony says
anyone should be able to edit the tags, but requester should have last say (so
can prevent a tag being added that they removed).

Read reply - ask for exchange read receipts, and show if mail was read.

Telephone numbers. Add advice in workflow to call authority first to check
form they have info in. Store telephone numbers in database.

Give authorities interface for editing their request email address
and resend messages to them

Make search know about uncategorised requests and timed out requests. 
And make search able to do *current* status in general as operator.

Test data dumper that removes sensitive data, but lets trusted people play with
whole database on their own machine without risk of compromise (for Tony)
- can avoid rebuilding emails, attachments etc. sanitized provided we don't
mind leaking out email address ot requests etc. to the trusted person (in contrast
can easily totally remove private emails in the user table)

Have an interface for users to be able to suggest new authorities and give
their email address (perhaps just have admins validate / approve it)

  their policy is, and hwo they are implementing it. Ask national things what
  odcuments set local policies.
