# Version 0.3

## Highlighted features
* New search filters / UI on request page, authorities page, and search page.  Upgrades require a rebuild of the Xapian index (`./script/xapian-index-rebuild`).  Design isn't beautiful; to be fixed in next release.
* Introduce reCaptcha for people apparently coming from foreign countries (to combat spam) (requires values for new config variables `ISO_COUNTRY_CODE` and `GAZE_URL`, and existing config variables `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`)
* Better admin interface for editing multiple translations of a public body at once
